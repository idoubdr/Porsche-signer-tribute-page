        <h2>Ultimate Choice.</h2>
        <h3>
          Our specification and restoration choices reflect our vision of an
          optimized air-cooled Porsche 911 and provide a broad canvas for
          individual self-expression and fine tailoring. Should you have special
          wishes or requests that go further than the choices listed below we
          will be happy to discuss them.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Such a degree of personalization ensures that each machine can be as
          sportingly focused, luxuriously flamboyant, or as simple and
          understated as desired. Indeed, we expect every restored and modified
          machine to represent and reflect the unique tastes and perspectives of
          its owner, whether targeted at regular use on the road or ultimate
          performance on road and track.
        </p>
        <p>
          We imagine most customers will specify a program that lies somewhere
          in the middle of these two extremes, resulting in a machine that
          reflects their ideal combination of sporting intent and daily
          usability.
        </p>
        <h2>DIVERS CUSTOMIZATION POSSIBILITIES</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>CHASSIS AND BODY</strong></li>
          <p>
            Our customers supply a fully road legal 1989-1994 Porsche 911 Coupe
            or Targa for the basis of restoration and varying degrees of
            modification. When the work is complete the car retains its Vehicle
            Identification Number (VIN), odometer reading and is legally
            registered, operated and licensed in the same manner. The cars are
            comprehensively disassembled and all bodywork to be replaced is
            removed from the car. The monocoque is media-blasted to bare metal
            and then treated for rust prevention.
          </p>
          <li><strong>ENGINE | EXHAUST | DRIVE AND TRANSMISSION</strong></li>
          <p>
            Our engines are completely disassembled then meticulously
            blueprinted, balanced and hand-built using new or state of the art
            components. Customers are offered a choice of three engines, each
            with a unique output and character, designed to match the dynamics
            of their car. • 3.8-liter, 300 horsepower • The 300BHP 3.8L engine
            is comprehensively rebuilt and blueprinted for maximum efficiency.
            It retains the standard Bosch Mo-tronic engine management system,
            exhaust, and ancillaries, therefore retains the engine’s original
            emission calibration.
          </p>
          <li><strong>ELECTRICAL | LIGHTING | GLASS</strong></li>
          <p>
            • The 25-plus year-old electrical system of the 964 is completely
            replaced with new technology. It is a lightweight system that
            surpasses most current road car and motorsport systems in quality,
            longevity, and functionality. At its heart is a state-of-the-art
            MoTeC M1 series Engine Control Unit operating in conjunction with
            dual MoTeC Power Distribution Modules [PDMs] and Bosch components
            that replaces the entire fuse system. The entire wire harness is
            manufactured by hand with motorsport/military-spec wiring and
            connections. Onboard data logging and diagnostic abilities allow
            remote access for service to our client’s vehicles wherever they may
            be in the world.
          </p>
          <li><strong>SUSPENSION | BRAKES | WHEELS</strong></li>
          <p>
            The standard suspension features adjustable KW coil-over
            spring/damper units. <br />
            The aluminum rear trailing arms are retained, and all bushings,
            drop-links, and front/rear sway bars are uprated. <br />
            The standard suspension is specified and set up to offer an
            excellent compromise between daily usability and sporting potential.
            It is specified – and tuned – to provide a compliant, quiet and
            comfortable ride on the street while still offering great control
            during fast road use. <br />
            Suspension Options
          </p>
          <li><strong>COLORS</strong></li>
          <p>
            We have meticulously researched and blended colors which we feel
            complement the classic curves of our machines and recall some of the
            vivid hues pioneered in the 1960s and 70s. Singer uses only the
            finest Sikkens color-bases and clear-coats, ensuring a beautiful and
            durable finish.
          </p>
          <li><strong>INTERIOR</strong></li>
          <p>
            The vehicle comes with a bespoke interior that recalls the 1960s and
            70s, the golden age of early car décor. Huge attention to detail has
            been paid to present an interior rich in ambiance and finished with
            exquisite details. This interior treatment can be personalized in a
            number of different ways through the selection of certain optional
            materials and fittings. These items can alter the character of the
            interior towards a luxury or sporting intent or indeed any
            combination of the two.
